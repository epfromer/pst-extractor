Extract objects from MS Outlook/Exchange PST files

## Features

Extract objects from MS Outlook/Exchange PST files.

This is based off code from https://github.com/rjohnsondev/java-libpst. Thanks to Richard Johnson and Orin Eman.

A spec from Microsoft on the PST file format is at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff385210(v=office.12).aspx.

Note that this tool does NOT work with corrupt PST files.

## Install

```npm install --save pst-extractor```

or

```yarn add pst-extractor```

## Usage

Start with the example app to walk the PST and print out the folder structure to the console. Also, most of the major objects have Jest test specs which show how the object attributes can be accessed.

```bash
cd example
npm start
```

or

```bash
cd example
yarn start
```

This runs on a sample Enron dataset that you can replace with your own PST file.

A simple script looks like this:

```javascript
import { PSTMessage } from 'pst-extractor';
import { PSTFile } from 'pst-extractor';
import { PSTFolder } from 'pst-extractor';
const resolve = require('path').resolve;

let depth = -1;
let col = 0;

const pstFile = new PSTFile(resolve('/path/to/some/pst.pst'));
console.log(pstFile.getMessageStore().displayName);
processFolder(pstFile.getRootFolder());

/**
 * Walk the folder tree recursively and process emails.
 * @param {PSTFolder} folder
 */
function processFolder(folder: PSTFolder) {
    depth++;

    // the root folder doesn't have a display name
    if (depth > 0) {
        console.log(getDepth(depth) + folder.displayName);
    }

    // go through the folders...
    if (folder.hasSubfolders) {
        let childFolders: PSTFolder[] = folder.getSubFolders();
        for (let childFolder of childFolders) {
            processFolder(childFolder);
        }
    }

    // and now the emails for this folder
    if (folder.contentCount > 0) {
        depth++;
        let email: PSTMessage = folder.getNextChild();
        while (email != null) {
            console.log(getDepth(depth) + 
                'Sender: ' + email.senderName + 
                ', Subject: ' + email.subject);
            email = folder.getNextChild();
        }
        depth--;
    }
    depth--;
}

/**
 * Returns a string with visual indication of depth in tree.
 * @param {number} depth
 * @returns {string}
 */
function getDepth(depth: number): string {
    let sdepth = '';
    if (col > 0) {
        col = 0;
        sdepth += '\n';
    }
    for (let x = 0; x < depth - 1; x++) {
        sdepth += ' | ';
    }
    sdepth += ' |- ';
    return sdepth;
}
```

and will generate the following output:
